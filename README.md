# Floppy Dirk

Floppy Dirk is a clone of the side-scroller game Flappy Bird, on which the player controls a bird.
The goal of the game is to go as far away as possible while flying between columns of green pipes without colliding against them.

The pipes are randomly generated infinitely, until the player eventually dies when hitting any of them.
